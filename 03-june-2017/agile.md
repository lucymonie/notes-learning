## Learning more about agile

Agile:
- the aim is to build working software that meets customer needs
- this is done by trusting individuals and teams to get it done
- teams talk about what they're working on and what's blocking them
- it's possible to change priorities in order to meet customer needs


### From [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
**Responding to change** over following a plan  

Not that the things on the right are unimportant, but the things on the left take priority  

### Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer  
through early and continuous delivery  
of valuable software.  

Welcome changing requirements, even late in  
development. Agile processes harness change for  
the customer's competitive advantage.  

Deliver working software frequently, from a  
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a  
preference to the shorter timescale.  

Business people and developers must work  
together daily throughout the project.  

Build projects around motivated individuals.  
Give them the environment and support they need,  
and trust them to get the job done.  

The most efficient and effective method of  
conveying information to and within a development  
team is face-to-face conversation.  

Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

Agile processes promote sustainable development.  
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able  
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.  

Continuous attention to technical excellence  
and good design enhances agility.  

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount  
of work not done--is essential.  

The best architectures, requirements, and designs  
emerge from self-organizing teams.  

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how  
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts  
its behavior accordingly.
