## Setting up a LAMP stack

For Ubuntu users

[Digital Ocaean tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04)

It says to "visit your server's IP address", but you can just visit http://localhost to check if it's working.

Here are some questions that you might have:

- I installed apache, but http://localhost won't connect
- I can't find my document root
- I can't find my apache configuration
- I've got the web server running, but it's not executing any PHP

Next, create a file called `scratch.php` in your document root and copy the following code into it:
```
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<h1>My PHP Page</h1>
<?php
    echo '<p>';
    echo 'A paragraph generated by PHP on ' . date('d-m-y');
    echo '</p>';
?>
</body>
</html>
```

You can play around with it to get started with using PHP. You'd view it by going to http://localhost/scratch.php.

For more basic PHP, there's a pretty reasonable course on codecademy: https://www.codecademy.com/learn/php

NOTE: You don't need to restart your web server after adding/modifying files in the document root. This is a common thing that people think after coming from node, where you regularly need to restart the server. You only need to restart Apache if you change the configuration (which I imagine you will only do once when enabling PHP).
