# How I got my first developer job

My name is Lucy Monie. I was part of FAC9. I have just accepted my first fulltime job as a developer, and I'm starting on Monday. This is a record of my journey so far.

I began coding in December 2015. I did a web developer course on skillcrush.com, which took me three months to complete. I was so excited by learning to code that I had to be dragged away from my laptop to eat Christmas lunch. At the time I was a freelance editor and mother to three small children (aged 5, 3 and 1). The elder two attended school and part-time nursery, the youngest was in my fulltime care. I used to have a tody house and cook a lot of food from scratch (I used to make my own museli). I had to let all that go - any spare minutes were diverted to trying to understand for loops, googling for answers that were usually to be found in mdn or stack overflow, and reading the documentation for ruby gems.

When I finished the course on Skillcrush I was fired up to learn more and it seemed as though a bootcamp would be a great idea. I did some research and I discovered that most bootcamps based in London cost in the order of Â£8000 for 3 months tuition. I read about one bootcamp that was free, but I figured there was no way in the world that I would get in, and anyway it was in Javascript, and I was not a big fan.

After doing the maths, I realised that the cost of fulltime childcare for my now 18-month-old baby would double the cost of the paid-for bootcamps. I realised that the viable way forward was to learn to love Javascript. By this time it was March - I didn't think it was viable to apply for the June cohort of Founders & Coders, but that the October cohort was more realistic. So I began working on Codewars problems, attempting awkwardly to engage with the community on codingforeveryone and building some totally terrible web apps with jquery. We got a nanny to help out a couple of days a week so I had some dedicated studying time.

I spent all my free time from March through to July working as hard as possible on codecademy, codewars and freecodecamp. I started meeting up with Cleo once a week to solve problems together and help each other publish our first katas and figure out how to write tests. I was offered a place on the 9th cohort of Founders & Coders at the end of July and, when I heard Cleo got in as well, I danced around the room with excitement. 

Founders & Coders was amazing. I had some small meltdowns when I realised how much older I was than everyone else and was humbled by their greater ability to learn and retain information. However, one of the best things I've realised is that there's scarcely any difference between us, despite an average gap of 15 years in age. I threw myself into the course, working most evenings and weekends. This was very hard on my family and towards the end of the course I had to rebalance things and adjust my expectation that I would be able to keep up with the pace the others were setting. I am naturally quite competitive and I found dialling things back extremely difficult.

The last hack week was with a group of charities and Yoti, an identity platform. We worked with the charities and Yoti to produce prototypes. Marko and I had the chance to work with Centrepoint, a youth homeless charity and we were given the opportunity to spend a month developing the prototype into a working app. This work was funded by Outlandish.

I knew the work on the app would only last a month, so I began looking for a job. In addition, my cohort was working hard to make improvements to the curriculum for the next cohort of Founders & Coders, which we were responsible for teaching. Between the work on the app, my job applications and the curriculum work, I had another overload situation on my hands. I decided to dial back my job search. 

In a way, this was quite useful as it forced me to think very carefully before applying for a job. I had to think carefully about the time I would have to put into tuning my resume and writing a good cover letter, the possible phone screen, tech test and final interview preparation that might follow. The result was that I applied for only a few positions and I learned a lot from them.

**The Guardian - Digital Development Fellowship**
I had a phone screen for this role. I didn't make it any further than that. The feedback I got was that most of my answers weemed to be based on things I had been taught and not based on my own experience. Since the role was a beginner one, I was puzzled by this as I had thought they were fine with people who had limited-to-zero experience. 

Key learning: When the company is well known and desirable, they get so many people applying that they don't have to settle for someone with zero experience. A beginner role will probably be taken by someone with a CS degree or at least a year of professional experience. Apply anyway as you will learn from it, but adjust your expectations downwards.

**Government Digital Service**
I had a phone screen, which went very well and I was offered an onsite interview, which was a two-hour affair involving a 40-minute pair-coding exercise followed by an hour and twenty minutes of technical and behavioural questions. The pair coding exercise started badly when I realised they were asking me to write an object constructor, which I had never given much attention since clearly functional programming is so much more beautiful and composable and maintainable. Needless to say, it went very badly and it cost me the job.

Key learning: you may not love OOP but most companies will expect you to know how to write an object constructor. Learn how to do it, and don't skimp on your knowledge of `this`, bindings and prototypal inheritance.

**Outlandish**
After the prototyping was finished, Outlandish invited me to stay on to work on some projects with them. The first piece of work they offered me was working by myself on a project in PHP. This struck me as terrifying but I said yes anyway. I ended up working on some totally exciting election projects and it was a wild ride until the pipeline dried up. 

Key learning: if someone offers you work and you're not sure if you can do it, say yes anyway. The learning curve will probably be steep but it's rewarding.

**8th Light**
If you apply to 8th Light they will pretty surely set you the task of refactoring a version of tic tac toe (noughts and crosses) that runs in the terminal. There is no time limit. When you submit your code they invite you in to give you some feedback. You go away with the feedback and try to improve your code (again with no time limit). If they like your resubmission, they will offer you a job. I was not offered a job but told to get more experience and try again.

Key learning: I learned an amazing amount from this technical challenge. 8th Light is very generous in the way they give feedback. I recommend going through this process if you have the patience for it. 

**Pixie Labs**
I applied to Pixie Labs because I liked the look of things they were building and work was slowing down with Outlandish. I had a video screen with the founder of the company, during which he asked me to define a closure and an inner join. I cursed myself for not paying more attention in class. They asked me to do a tech test and then an in person interview. Then they offered me the job. 

I liked them but it was a very small team and I felt unsure whether it would be a good fit. I stalled briefly and then asked if I could work for them on a contract-to-permanent basis. I think the question offended them, and when I turned the job down they seemed surprised and hurt. I liked them very much and in hindsight I think I could have handled this negotiation better.

Key learning: small companies often have fragile egos. If you want to work with them, don't tread on their dreams. Understand closures and joins. Know them in your sleep.

**Pivotal software internship**
I had a phone screen followed by a pair coding session onsite. The pair coding session was conducted in a small glass room with two super-serioud developers. One of them drove, and the code was on a massive screen on the wall. The task was to (re)create Sets as a class in Java. There was a very clear agenda and I evidently wasn't following it. Oh god.

Key learning: there are some places where you're not meant to work. At least you know that now.

**Cubik Labs**
These guys are well known to Founders & Coders and given the rave reviews, I thought I would apply. I had a phone screen, they seemed lovely but it was clear that my lack of familiarity with React, Redux, Typescript, D3 and other key tools was an issue. 

Key learning: if you love the sound of a company, do some tutorials in their key technologies to show your keenness as it might pay dividends.

**The Guardian clientside developer**
Yes, I am a sucker for punishment. I applied for this role, hoping to get a phone interview so I could find out what the questions were (for future reference). I was so aware of my unsuitability for the role that I almost asked them to tell me the questions at the start of the intreview and then we could hang up and not waste anyone's time. However, I dutifully ploughed through them. 

They came back and asked me to do a remote test and then an onsite discussion and pairing test. I honestly expected to find they had me confused with someone else at the interview but no that was my code we were perusing. In the pairing test I had layer upon layer of difficulty as I didn't know require.js, I was working on a mac, which is like coding with mittens on when you come from Linux, and I was extremely nervous. I didn't get any further but I was amazed to get so far. The feedback I got said that they expected greater familiarity with build tools and more fluency in javascript.

Key learning: keep trying, learn build tools, know react/preact/vue/svelte/angular well enough to build something from scratch.

**Social Finance**
I had a phone screen, an onsite interview, a tech test and then an interview with the founder. I felt at ease with everyone and as though I could be completely myself. I'm starting on Monday. Wish me luck!
