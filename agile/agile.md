## Learning more about agile

- the aim is to build working software that meets customer needs
- this is done by trusting individuals and teams to get it done
- teams talk about what they're working on and what's blocking them
- it's possible to change priorities in order to meet customer needs


### From [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/)
**Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools  
**Working software** over comprehensive documentation  
**Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation  
**Responding to change** over following a plan  

The things on the right are important, but the things on the left take priority  

### Agile 2.0
Ultra-light versions of Agile, include Lean and Kanban. Lean originated from the ideals of the Toyota Production System (zero waste, total quality and more customer value). These ideas were imported and applied to software development.

Software projects that mnimise waste, aim for quality, look at the big picture and deliver value to customers are essentially Agile, but with less heft than Agile 1.0. Kanban takes ideas from Agile and Lean and combines them into an alternative lightweight Agile method.
